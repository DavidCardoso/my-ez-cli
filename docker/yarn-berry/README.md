# Yarn Berry (v2) via Docker

- [GitHub Yarn Berry](https://github.com/yarnpkg/berry)

## Usage

All the Yarn Berry required files should be installed and configured here.

If necessary, just run yarn (or yarn-berry) in this directory to update yarn dependencies / cache.

> Cache is being ignored (i.e., not being pushed to the remote repo).

Avoid using different Yarn versions.

However, if needed, you can run yarn classic as `yarn` and the latest as `yarn-berry`. Just choose it during installation process using `/repo-root-path/setup.sh`.
